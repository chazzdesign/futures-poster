### How to update this project

- This project contains a Github webhook that is triggered every time a `git
push` is made on your local computer. 
- Whenever you push some code, the weebhook will ping the Glitch
server updating the code and refreshing the app.
- This means that **you don't need to update the project on the Glitch editor, just develop locally, commit your code and do a `git push`.**
- If you edit the code in Glitch and the update the code in Github, the code in Glitch will be lost.
