### How to update project

- This project contains a Github webhook that is triggered every time a `git
push` is made on your local computer. 
- Whenever a new push is made, the weebhook will ping the Glitch
server both updating the code and refreshing the app. 
- This means that **you don't need to update the project on the Glitch editor, just develop locally, commit your code and do a `git push`.**
